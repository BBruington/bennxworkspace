He explains their situation of becoming prisoners tasked with taking on jobs from their new lord: Silver Eye Lumin Eos. And to gauge the party's worth, Scrapper has them freed to take on an assault from strange ant-like creatures equiped with acid and mandibles. By the end of the fight, the party narrowly wins but at the cost of one of them: Grifith going unconscious and becoming possesed by a fiendish black blade. Scrapper manages to subdue the possesed player and entombs him in a cocoon of divine ice using a magical item; a small shard of ice that must be injested.",
